# INTRODUCTION
The 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) is a fundamental instrument for diagnosing cardiac conditions. Traditionally, 12-lead ECG are analyzed by trained medical professionals, however recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and deep convolutional neural networks have enabled algorithms that can accurately analyze ECGs [1, 2, 3].
 
Such algorithms proved capable of accurately recognizing specific patterns and abnormalities in ECG waveforms. Namely, they can detect subtle anomalies invisible to the human eye, allowing, for example, to detect cardiac contractile dysfunction from an “apparently” normal ECG [4] or the presence of an underlying atrial fibrillation from a sinus rhythm ECG [5]. Altogether, these findings highlight the potential of an AI-based ECG analysis, with significant implications for early detection and management of different cardiac conditions.
